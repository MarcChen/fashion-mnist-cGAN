# Fashion MNIST Conditional GAN

This repository implements a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. **Modeling & Generation**: Build a Conditional GAN that learns to produce high-quality images of fashion items conditioned on their class labels (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags).  
2. **Data Analysis & Insights**: Use data science techniques to analyze the generated images, uncovering patterns, biases, or trends that emerge when conditioning on different classes.

## Key Features

- **Conditional GAN Architecture**: Implements a generator and discriminator designed to incorporate class label information, ensuring that the generated images correspond to specific fashion categories.
- **Comprehensive Training Pipeline**: Includes data loading, model definition, training scripts, and evaluation metrics.
- **Visualization & Analysis**: Offers notebooks and scripts to visualize generated samples, track training progress, and derive insights from the model’s outputs.
- **Reproducible Setup**: Provides clear instructions and environment configurations for easy reproduction of results.

## Goals

1. **Understand Conditional Image Generation**: Explore how conditioning on class labels influences the diversity and realism of generated images.
2. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Employ metrics like FID or qualitative assessments to measure how closely generated samples resemble real data.
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Apply clustering, dimensionality reduction, and other data analysis techniques to the generated dataset to find interesting patterns and relationships.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Make the setup script executable and run it to install dependencies and download the dataset:
    ```sh
    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```
2. **Train the Model**: Run the training scripts to fit the Conditional GAN on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
3. **Analyze Results**: Use provided notebooks to visualize generated samples, monitor learning curves, and extract insights from the model’s latent representations.

By engaging with this repository, you will gain practical experience with conditional generative modeling and learn how to leverage data science methods to deepen your understanding of model-generated outputs.
